                <h2 class="article-title">My name is John and living the simple
                    life saved my life</h2>
                <p class="article-body"><strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>
                    I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the
                    truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it becuase there
                    was too much.
                </p>
                
                <p> Things were terrible. I had job that I hated,
                    a home that I didn't want ot live in, and I couldn't hold a
                    relationship.</p>

                <h3 class="article-name">>How I turned things around</h3>
                <p><strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of
                        everything. </strong>
                    I literally put 90% of my possession in the garbage, sold my place and moved
                    into a smaller aparment, and I quit my job.</p>
                <p>It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad
                    place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.</p>
                <h3 class="article-name">>Now I live the simple life.</h3>
                <p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better.I'm less stressed,
                    enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time ot enjoy.
                </p>
                <p>With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like I gad no choice but to start sharing how I did it</strong>
                    , and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site! </p>
